Duplicates values  is not there. ====   I checked using duplicates option in excel									
find null value is not there so that is the reason  it cames false									
I standardized the values 'male' and 'female' by capitalizing the first letter.									
I changed column name genre to gender 									
I applied the dollar format to the Annual Income column to clearly represent the values as currency									
I created the line chart to gender and annual income									
I applied conditional formatting to the entire table.
